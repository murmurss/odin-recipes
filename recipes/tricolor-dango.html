        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak 12 bamboo skewers in water</li>
                <li>Mix together <strong>non-glutinous rice flour</strong> and <strong>glutinous rice flour</strong> in a bowl.
                Add <strong>powdered sugar</strong> to make dango sweeter.</li>   
                <li>Add in <strong>hot water</strong> and mix with spoon. As dough begins to take shape, use your hands to mold it.<br>
                <em>You may need to add more flour or more water to reach desired clay-like consistency.</em></li>
                <li>Divide dough into 3 even portions. Place each in its own bowl.<br>
                <h4>To Make Pink Dango</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add one drop of <strong>pink food coloring</strong> to dough and work it in.</li>
                        <li>Avoid adding additional coloring as it will darken as it cooks.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>To Make Green Dango</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make matcha paste by mixing together <strong>matcha powder</strong> with equal part of water.</li>
                        <li>Once paste is formed, mix into dough.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>To Make White Dango</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No additional steps are necessary.</li><br>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Divide each dough into 12 balls per color. If you have a kitchen scale handy, each ball should be close to 20 g.</li>    
                <li>Boil a pot of water to cook the dango. Cook each color seperately to avoid staining the other dango. <br>
                <em>Dango should be cooked in order of white, pink, green.</em></li>
                <li>After about 2 minutes, or once dango have risen to surface of water, take them out of the pot and immediately submerge 
                    into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.</li>
                <li>Add dango to skewers in this order: <strong>green, white, pink</strong>.<br>
